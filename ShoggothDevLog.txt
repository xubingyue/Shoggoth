Working on synths. Need to explore scanned synthesis and wave terrain synthesis with buffers filled by the terrains.

Work done on sequencing.

To Do:

1. Priority based scheduling!! 2 different threads with different priority?  Will be loose, some other method of deferring GUI calls? elapsed time checks?

2. Implement ShSeqPath sequencing!

3. Implement Semaphore to close out all threads!…somehow…
